It also can be an important avenue for discernment of the student's professional ministry and calling. Candler also offers a number of summer internships that feature paid positions in congregations.

It covers historical and theoretical underpinnings of maternal and child health problems and programs aimed to reduce morbidity, mortality, and health disparities. Skills in program planning and evaluation are taught through multidisciplinary teams working with academic and field-based faculty in local, state, federal, and nongovernmental agencies. Maternal and child health is defined as a field of public health that addresses underlying forces for these problems, the historical framework for ameliorating those problems, and current programs and policies that have evolved from that historical context. Maternal and child health programs are unique to reproduction and life course development; more common in women, infants, children, or adolescents; more serious in women, infants, children, or adolescents; or have manifestations, risk factors, or interventions that are different in women or during life course development.",,Sarah Blake,scblake@emory.edu,F 9am-11:50am,R.

This is puzzling because lawyers tend to enjoy high standards of living and rewarding career opportunities. In this course, we will use this puzzle as a jumping off place to explore the emergent field of hedonics: the scientific study of happiness. In the past decades, researchers have analyzed this topic not as a matter of philosophy or theology but through empirical analysis. Studies on hedonics have delivered insights, often counterintuitive ones, on these most elemental of questions: What makes us happy? What does it mean for humans to flourish? What, ultimately, is the good life? In this course, we will explore the emergent literature on hedonics, which helps to illuminate what makes humans happy and unhappy. We will also analyze the legal profession through the lens of this work to consider why lawyers tend to report high levels of unhappiness. Fortunately, this research shows that happiness is not fixed or inevitable. On the contrary, we have significant control over our own subjective well-being.

The seminar explores the relationship between law and the theoretical concept of vulnerability, from both an abstract and a practical perspective. The course is anchored in the understanding that fundamental to our shared humanity is our shared vulnerability, which is universal and constant and inherent in the human condition. It will offer students an opportunity to engage with multiple perspectives on vulnerability, with an emphasis on law, justice, state policy, and legislative ethics. While vulnerability can never be eliminated, society through its institutions confers certain ""assets"" or resources, such as wealth, health, education, family relationships, and marketable skills on individuals and groups. These assets give individuals ""resilience"" in the face of their vulnerability. This seminar will explore how as society now is structured, however, certain individuals and groups operate from positions of entrenched advantage or privilege, while others are disadvantaged in ways that seem to be invisible as we engage in law and policy discussions. This seminar offers new ways to conceptualize and argue for reform in the interest of achieving social justice.",,Martha Fineman,mlfinem@emory.edu,T 2pm-4pm,Gambrell Hall 5G,,SEM,EM

Over 135 law schools in North America offer courses in animal law, six specialty journals are devoted to the topic, and at least one poll indicates a career in the area is in the top seven of all desired careers.

Nonhuman animals are considered property under law, and a sprawling body of federal and state civil and criminal law regulates human use of them. This seminar will explore our legal and ethical obligations to nonhuman animals, focusing on domestic animals. Selected topics may include: conceptions of animals, standing to sue on behalf of animals, preemption of animal protection statutes, companion animal abuse, breed discrimination, exotic pets and public health, veterinary malpractice, farm animals, hunted and poached animals, exhibited animals, service and emotional support animals, police and military dogs, exhibited and entertainment animals, laboratory animals, animals used for fiber and medicine, animals and religious freedom, and animal trusts and custody.

The Integrative Project will normally be taken as an additional one-credit-hour requirement in conjunction with a three-hour course in which the student is already enrolled and is an approved elective for the WTM certificate. Students also may enroll in a one hour directed reading course with a faculty member with whom they have previously studied in an approved WTM course to continue research begun in a previous course. Approval of the WTM director and faculty member is required in both cases.",,Susan Hylen,susan.hylen@emory.edu,,,,SUP,EM
