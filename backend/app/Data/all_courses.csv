The Making of Global Christianity,HC509,,3,,,EM,"Christianity was a demonstrably global faith (with its center of gravity in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East) before it became a predominantly Western religion (c. 1500). Now, after roughly five centuries, it has once again reemerged as a hugely non-Western phenomenon. A full historical account reveals a faith that is inherently global because it is ultimately local and therefore never fully defined by any historic phase or context. This course provides an exploration of Christianity's 2,000 year history with a primary focus on the processes of cross-cultural transmission and the critical elements that have defined the experience and expression of the faith in successive heartlands. Five core issues will guide the discussion: the translation principle (or indigenous appropriations and vernacular expressions of the faith); the agents and agencies of missionary expansion; major movements of reformation and renewal; interaction with other major faiths; and causative factors in the periodic shifts or extermination of the faith.",,

Supply Chain Management,ISOM553,,3,,,EM,"In some industries, supplying goods to customers is primarily controlled within an organization, and a classic example of this structure was the Ford plant at Highland Park. Today advances in communication and transportation have led to complex supply chains that span organizations and continents. This course will combine cases and readings to allow students to understand the operations and economics of supply chains, and how companies use supply chain management in creating a competitive advantage. This will require the development of some analytic tools for determining operating policies that effectively manage the numerous trade-offs in supply chains. We will also be careful, though, to put these decisions in the context of the overall strategy of the firm. Supply chains are a natural place to examine global operations, where links of the supply chain are located around the world in an attempt to successfully compete. Students with an interest in careers in consulting or in  operations functions are the primary target for this course. But supply chain organizations are often closely tied to marketing functions, and supply chains have on the financial structure of the firm.",,

Second, students will receive real recent criminal case warrants and police reports and participate in mock classroom hearings designed to mirror in all aspects the actual legal proceedings of those cases.

Kids in Conflict with Law,LAW699,,2,,,EM,"The juvenile court was founded in 1899 on the philosophy that children are inherently different from adults, and that the state should take on the responsibility of protecting and rehabilitating young offenders. Beginning in the late twentieth century, the court has undergone both an ideological and an institutional change from its original form. This course will trace the trajectory of juvenile justice in the United States over the course of the last century, from its birth as a separate system in the early 1900s, through the due process revolution of the 1960s and 1970s and the widespread punitive reforms of the 1990s, to the recent rulings on the juvenile death penalty, juvenile life without parole, and juvenile interrogations.

In this course, students will review real world examples where defense attorneys and prosecutors have been censured and even in some cases, disbarred. The expectation is that students will know not only how to practice within the ethical and professional rules of conduct but to also use their own moral compass to guide their behavior and decisions.

Happiness and the Law,LAW704,spring,2,,,EM,"Law students and lawyers in the United States report high levels of unhappiness. This is puzzling because lawyers tend to enjoy high standards of living and rewarding career opportunities. In this course, we will use this puzzle as a jumping off place to explore the emergent field of hedonics: the scientific study of happiness. In the past decades, researchers have analyzed this topic not as a matter of philosophy or theology but through empirical analysis. Studies on hedonics have delivered insights, often counterintuitive ones, on these most elemental of questions: What makes us happy? What does it mean for humans to flourish? What, ultimately, is the good life? In this course, we will explore the emergent literature on hedonics, which helps to illuminate what makes humans happy and unhappy. We will also analyze the legal profession through the lens of this work to consider why lawyers tend to report high levels of unhappiness. Fortunately, this research shows that happiness is not fixed or inevitable. On the contrary, we have significant control over our own subjective well-being. To that end, we will not only read about and discuss the insights of the hedonics research, but will apply it to our daily lives in systematic ways that aspire to increase our happiness over the course of the semester.",,

Article 9 methods used by a creditor to obtain priority over other creditors in the payment of obligations owed to it will be contrasted with other methods of credit enhancement, including structural subordination using legal entities, subordination by contract, and use of letters of credit. This course does not serve as a substitute for a course on bankruptcy law, though the impact of a debtor's bankruptcy on a secured creditor will be discussed. The course will focus on business financings rather than consumer financings, including the basics of borrowing base credits, factoring, securitization, syndicated lending, and legal opinions related to secured financings (though selected issues related to consumers will be discussed).to a debtor in such a scenario.

Approval of the WTM director and faculty member is required in both cases.",,
