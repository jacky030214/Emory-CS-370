Specific topics include: (1) parametric and non-parametric methods for modeling non-linear relationships (e.g., splines and generalized additive models); (2) methods for modeling longitudinal and multi-level data that account for within group correlation (e.g., mixed-effect models, generalized estimating equations); (3) Bayesian methods; and (4) shrinkage methods and bias-variance tradeoffs.  This course draws motivating examples from environmental and social epidemiology, health services research, clinical studies, and behavioral sciences. The course provides a survey of advanced regression approaches with a focus on data analysis and interpretation. Students will gain an understanding of methods that will facilitate future independent and collaborative research for modern research problems. Students will gain practical experience using the R language for statistical computing.

Epidemiologists design studies and analyses to minimize both sources of error. When presenting results, epidemiologists use statistics to quantify the impact of random error on estimates of effect, but often only qualitatively describe residual systematic error (uncontrolled bias). Bias analysis provides one method of quantifying residual systematic error. Students in this course will learn how to use simple, multidimensional, and probabilistic bias analyses, as well as direct bias modeling (regression calibration and missing data methods) to account for systematic error in their estimates of effect.

It is a quasi-federal polity focused on uniting its Member States around a set of common values and a common market. As the world's largest economy and trading block, the EU is an important source of unique policies and legal norms. These policies and norms are affecting trade and investment relationships globally. The overlapping geopolitical concerns and shared values make the EU one of the United States' most important partners economically, politically, and socially. U.S. lawyers, public servants, and activists are consequently being called upon to engage with (and understand) European legal principles and practices to an ever-growing degree.

The internal market is a space where people, goods, services and capital can move freely and where fair competition is not distorted either by state or business actors. To promote greater understanding and interest, the course emphasizes the differences and commonalities between the EU (an international polity with federal aspirations) and the U.S. system (federal state). The course will conclude with student group presentations on current EU law and policy issues and a take-home exam. Students will be discussing specific pieces of EU legislation, analyzing case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and national courts of the EU Member States.

Halakhah is not a set of rules imposed by the state, things that happen in court, or standards that regulate relationships among people and between individuals and society. Halakhah does many of the things that other cultures treat as philosophy, ethics, politics, and theology, while injecting them with a distinctly legal form.

While there are certainly benefits to interdisciplinary scholarship, such approaches also pose a unique set of challenges. The success of interdisciplinary scholarship depends on the scholar's ability to communicate to audiences who often use different nomenclature, evidence, and analytical methods. A failure to appreciate these challenges can lead to attempts at interdisciplinary scholarship that are reductive, one- sided, vague, or confused. In this course, students will survey the interdisciplinary field of law and religion. The course will begin by discussing the nature of the field known as law and religion. What areas of inquiry constitute this field? What do we mean when we talk about 'law' and 'religion'? The course will then cover different substantive areas and methodological approaches by reading, analyzing, and critiquing examples of law and religion scholarship from leading scholars. Students will be asked to think about the choices that scholars make: What is the relationship of law and religion in this example of scholarship? What does the scholar draw on as evidence for the argument? How does the scholar construct the argument? How does the scholar think about law? How does the scholar think about religion? These and other questions will help students understand how different approaches function; what they can achieve; what they cannot achieve; and why a scholar would choose a certain approach.

They have also developed new approaches that are specifically adapted to the demands of development planning and practice. While some of these emphasize statistical methods and experimental designs, many development research approaches are grounded in participatory and qualitative research methods that allow for (and aim to elucidate) the multiple interpretations of social reality that make development work in cross-cultural settings so very complicated. These qualitative and participatory research methods are characterized by flexible and adaptive research design; an emphasis on the conceptual and interpretive frameworks of research participants rather than those of the researcher; and continued and strong reflection by the researcher on his or her own influence on the production of data. The first semester of this two-course sequence covers qualitative research design and methods in development work through discussion of different approaches to research, examination of qualitative research studies, and the design of a study and data collection through a group research project. Students consider the role of inquiry in development work and discuss the particular strengths (and weaknesses) of different types of research for development practice. They gain applied skills in qualitative research design, document analysis, stakeholder analysis, visual methods, participant-observation, individual interviewing, focus group interviewing, writing fieldnotes, the evaluation of qualitative research studies, and professional writing.

We will also consider the influences that non-Buddhist systems, worldviews, and practices have had on Socially Engaged Buddhist activists and movements around the world.
