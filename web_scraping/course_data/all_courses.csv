Observational epidemiologic studies yield estimates of effect that differ from the true effect because of random error and systematic error. Epidemiologists design studies and analyses to minimize both sources of error. When presenting results, epidemiologists use statistics to quantify the impact of random error on estimates of effect, but often only qualitatively describe residual systematic error (uncontrolled bias). Bias analysis provides one method of quantifying residual systematic error. Students in this course will learn how to use simple, multidimensional, and probabilistic bias analyses, as well as direct bias modeling (regression calibration and missing data methods) to account for systematic error in their estimates of effect. Students should expect to gain new skills, as the emphasis of the course will be on the implementation and conduct of bias analysis, rather than statistical theory.",,Timothy Lash,timothy.lee.lash@emory.edu,Th 1pm-2:50pm,Claudia Nance Rollins TBA,,LEC,EM

While there are certainly benefits to interdisciplinary scholarship, such approaches also pose a unique set of challenges. The success of interdisciplinary scholarship depends on the scholar's ability to communicate to audiences who often use different nomenclature, evidence, and analytical methods. A failure to appreciate these challenges can lead to attempts at interdisciplinary scholarship that are reductive, one- sided, vague, or confused.

What areas of inquiry constitute this field? What do we mean when we talk about 'law' and 'religion'? The course will then cover different substantive areas and methodological approaches by reading, analyzing, and critiquing examples of law and religion scholarship from leading scholars. Students will be asked to think about the choices that scholars make: What is the relationship of law and religion in this example of scholarship? What does the scholar draw on as evidence for the argument? How does the scholar construct the argument? How does the scholar think about law? How does the scholar think about religion? These and other questions will help students understand how different approaches function; what they can achieve; what they cannot achieve; and why a scholar would choose a certain approach.

They have also developed new approaches that are specifically adapted to the demands of development planning and practice. While some of these emphasize statistical methods and experimental designs, many development research approaches are grounded in participatory and qualitative research methods that allow for (and aim to elucidate) the multiple interpretations of social reality that make development work in cross-cultural settings so very complicated. These qualitative and participatory research methods are characterized by flexible and adaptive research design; an emphasis on the conceptual and interpretive frameworks of research participants rather than those of the researcher; and continued and strong reflection by the researcher on his or her own influence on the production of data. The first semester of this two-course sequence covers qualitative research design and methods in development work through discussion of different approaches to research, examination of qualitative research studies, and the design of a study and data collection through a group research project. Students consider the role of inquiry in development work and discuss the particular strengths (and weaknesses) of different types of research for development practice. They gain applied skills in qualitative research design, document analysis, stakeholder analysis, visual methods, participant-observation, individual interviewing, focus group interviewing, writing fieldnotes, the evaluation of qualitative research studies, and professional writing.

GH 598 is the GH Capstone Integrative Learning Experience and is taken in the student's final semester. The Capstone provides an opportunity for students to demonstrate skills acquired in prior coursework. Each capstone section will differ in content, based on instructor expertise, but all will require integration of deliverables from the HDGH Foundational, Program Cycle, and Quantitative and Qualitative sequences. At the end of the capstone course, each student will submit an individual deliverable in response to a global health challenge or opportunity. The deliverable may describe a program implementation plan or a formative research plan that will inform a future project, program or policy. All Capstone sections share the same underlying structure, of 10-15 students working closely with the instructor. The course is graded as Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory.",,Robert Bednarczyk,robert.a.bednarczyk@emory.edu,MW 3pm-4:50pm,Grace Crum Rollins P39,,SEM,EM

Now, after roughly five centuries, it has once again reemerged as a hugely non-Western phenomenon. A full historical account reveals a faith that is inherently global because it is ultimately local and therefore never fully defined by any historic phase or context. This course provides an exploration of Christianity's 2,000 year history with a primary focus on the processes of cross-cultural transmission and the critical elements that have defined the experience and expression of the faith in successive heartlands. Five core issues will guide the discussion: the translation principle (or indigenous appropriations and vernacular expressions of the faith); the agents and agencies of missionary expansion; major movements of reformation and renewal; interaction with other major faiths; and causative factors in the periodic shifts or extermination of the faith.",,Jehu Hanciles,jjhanciles@emory.edu,W 1pm-3pm,Rita Anne Rollins Building_401,,LEC,EM

This is puzzling because lawyers tend to enjoy high standards of living and rewarding career opportunities. In this course, we will use this puzzle as a jumping off place to explore the emergent field of hedonics: the scientific study of happiness. In the past decades, researchers have analyzed this topic not as a matter of philosophy or theology but through empirical analysis. Studies on hedonics have delivered insights, often counterintuitive ones, on these most elemental of questions: What makes us happy? What does it mean for humans to flourish? What, ultimately, is the good life? In this course, we will explore the emergent literature on hedonics, which helps to illuminate what makes humans happy and unhappy. We will also analyze the legal profession through the lens of this work to consider why lawyers tend to report high levels of unhappiness. Fortunately, this research shows that happiness is not fixed or inevitable. On the contrary, we have significant control over our own subjective well-being.
